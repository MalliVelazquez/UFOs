# UFOs


## Overview

Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. We'll be adding table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
Main objective of this challenge is to create a web page that makes searching a more smoothly process for users. 

## Results

First, we add images to the head so visually is more attractive
